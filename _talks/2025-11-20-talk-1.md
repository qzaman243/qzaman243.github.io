Developed a hybrid log classification system combining Regex rules, Sentence Transformers with Logistic Regression, and
LLMs to handle logs of varying complexity.

Built and deployed a FastAPI-based RESTful service for real-time log processing and seamless system integration.

Achieved a 40% improvement in log classification accuracy compared to traditional rule-based approaches.

Reduced operational costs by 30% by automating log analysis and minimizing manual intervention.

Implemented an end-to-end NLP pipeline from preprocessing to model inference and deployment.
**Technologies**: Python, FastAPI, Sentence Transformers, scikit-learn, LLMs
